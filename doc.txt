    Search any meal from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).# search api
    Each search result of the meal should have a favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).

    On clicking any particular search result (any meal), open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page)
    # details

    Make this list persistent (should have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
    Remove from favourites button: Each meal should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
